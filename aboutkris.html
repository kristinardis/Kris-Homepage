    <h3>A little history</h3>
    <p> <br>
      Hello! I have been a resident of Coeur d'Alene since 1984. My husband and I opened a business here which we just sold in 2021.<br><br> Upon "retirement" from that business I was thrilled to find that in Spring of 2022 I had been accepted into the Graphic Design program here at N.I.C, and so I began this new journey in the Fall, last year.<br><br> Currently, I am the vice-chair for the CDA Arts Alliance, which provides art and music to the area, free of charge. Also, I am the Communications Secretary for a group called PEO, which raises money to help women who are returning to school to finish their education.<br><br>I spend a fair amount of time helping these organizations to raise money by teaching cooking classes and providing other skills to raise funds.<br><br> Over the years I have served in a number of capacities and also donated funds and time to many other organizations locally.<br><br> My main interest in graphic design is videography in all its forms: Movies, commercials, trailers, documentaries, and more.<br><br>I hope to intern with one of several companies in the area that provide those types of services. The Graphic Design department is set up to teach me those skills, which will be part of the coursework next year. Naturally, I will be pleased for multiple work experiences.<br><br>I am not a traditional student: I graduated from the University of Oregon in 1972 with a BA. I worked as a stockbroker from 1978-1988, and as a financial advisor here in Coeur d'Alene, while simultaneously running the business. That proved to be too much, so I retired my brokerage license in the early 1990's and developed our business as the community grew.<br><br> I returned to school part-time with Lewis Clark State College in mid-1990 and got my coursework done for a Bachelor degree in Social Work. I also studied culinary arts in Florence Italy for a time.<br><br> About the time the year 2000 rolled around, I became really interested in graphic design.  I have continued to adopt new strategies for design and life long learning, that I expect will continue.
